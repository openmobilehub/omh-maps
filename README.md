# OMH My feature

OMH is an open-source Android SDK to make easily swap between GMS, HMS and our custom OHM services.

It aims at creating low coupled, extensible SDK reducing the code boilerplate of switching between GMS, HMS, or any other service, and also provides a custom full open source alternative services switching automatically according to your configuration in the Gradle plugin giving the right outputs without overloading your APK with unnecessary libraries.
